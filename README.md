## Analyzing the Influence of Exposure to Autonomous Vehicle Technology on its Safety Perception ##

I used data from US.GOV regarding a survey that was carried out in Philadelphia in 2017 to see both how BikePGH donor-members, and Pittsburgh residents at large, feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. 

In this report, Bayesian ordinal logistic regression has been used to understand the influence of technological familiarity with AV on its safety perception and how people feel sharing roads with AVs. The dataset provides a distinctive opportunity to study the perspectives of an often underrepresented group in AV research, non-vehicular road users, who have been significantly impacted by the technology's implementation. The model revealed that familiarity with tech behind AVs lead to a higher safety perception, feel comfortable sharing roads with AV and believe it will play a positive role in preventing traffic injuries.
